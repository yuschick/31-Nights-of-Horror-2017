    "description": "Hellish visions fan the artistic flame of Jesse, an artist who works on commission, since he and his wife Astrid and daughter Zooey decided to move in a bargain of a house in Texas. However, unbeknownst to Jesse, the dark force that is strongly pulsating inside the place, is insidiously creeping into his mind through an ongoing battering of evil static that, sooner or later, will compel the unaware vessel into a disturbingly wonderful artistic paroxysm."
